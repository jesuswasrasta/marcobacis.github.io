### Who?

Hi there! I'm Marco and this is my personal website, where I'm going to put informations about me and what I do (and some blog posts when I'll feel creative).

I started programming when I was 12 (just a tiny little bullied nerd in middle school) with the classic web stack known as LAMP (ðŸ’¡).
High school and hobbies (guitar first, then photography) kicked in at 14 and I lost touch with web development (does VB.NET at high-school-level counts as programming?).

To reconnect with my long-lost friend the PC, I entered university ([Politecnico di Milano](polimi.it)) to study CS & Engineering. After a love/hate relationship with my bachelor years, I'm still in the same university doing my master's ðŸ˜œ.

### What?

I'm currently doing research at [NECSTLab](necst.it) for my master's thesis.
I've been "working" there since my bachelor, when I learned to program FPGAs using high level languages (C/C++ instead of HDL).

Now I'm trying to reach a even higher level, as my research involves managing FPGA boards inside the cloud environment.
My aim is to prove that FPGAs can be provided "as-a-service" and orchestrated in order to guarantee their 100% usage.
That's why I'll write something here about my thesis, talking about docker, kubernetes, FPGAs and wathever I find interesting.

### Why?

I love programming and computers in general, as they allow to "create" without much effort and investment.
Everyone can learn and create on the web, and currently also in the physical world (looking at you, 3D!), just by buying or even just renting a PC/laptop/raspberry/wathever!

Also, anyone can show their knowledge and opinions without restrictions in most of the world, and all this information is available to everyone with an internet connection.

That's why I decided to learn programming and software engineering, and also why I'm opening a small window into my world (this website).

Hope you'll enjoy it!
