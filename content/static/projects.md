### ðŸ’ª Coding Challenges ([github](https://github.com/marcobacis/coding-challenges))

[Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) is a set of challenges created by [John Crickett](https://github.com/JohnCrickett). Each challenge consist of a small, real-world project that can be implemented in any language and at any time. 

I love this initiative! I tend to not have any ideas of my own (or I think they are usually stupid and useless), and having a direction to follow and some examples to insipe me is great.

In the link above you can find the repository with all the solutions I came up with. As I am currently learning Rust in my spare time, most of the solutions are in Rust. I might use a different technology for others (e.g. web-based stuff?).

Enjoy!

### ðŸŽ„ Advent Of Code Solutions ([github](https://github.com/marcobacis/adventofcode))

Last year (2021) I tried solving some [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. It's a fun way to write some code in the free time.

In 2021 I solved some challenges (up until day 18, then I went on vacation and completely forgot about it ðŸ˜…) using python.

This time (2022) I'm solving them using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (Disclaimer: I'm learning it **while** solving the challeges, so it will be ugly!).

During university I did some toy projects and a bit of research projects, you can find them [here](./university)
