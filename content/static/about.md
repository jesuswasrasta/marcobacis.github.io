### Who?

{{<avatar>}}

Hi there! I'm Marco and this is my personal website, where I'm going to put informations about me and what I do (and some blog posts when I'll feel creative).

I started programming when I was 12 (just a tiny little bullied nerd in middle school) with the classic web stack known as LAMP (ðŸ’¡).
High school and hobbies (guitar first, then photography) kicked in at 14 and I lost touch with web development (does VB.NET at high-school-level counts as programming?).

To reconnect with my long-lost friend the PC, I entered university ([Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it)) to study CS & Engineering. After getting my bachelor and master there, I now entered the workforce as a software engineer.

### What?

While in university, i ended up doing research at [NECSTLab](https://www.necst.it).
I mostly worked on FPGA-based projects for High Performance Computing, using high level languages (e.g. C++).
My master thesis research involved managing FPGA boards inside the cloud environment.
The aim was to prove that FPGAs can be provided "as-a-service" and orchestrated in order to guarantee their 100% usage.

From 2019 to the end of 2023, I worked at [e-Novia](https://e-novia.it) as Software Engineer. The company acts both as a consultancy company (mostly in the automotive sector) and as a "startup factory".
My role as a Software Engineer was to support startups and corporate customers in creating and maintaining their products (mostly MVPs, with few live products).
In e-Novia I worked on quite different technologies, from low (C++) to high (Web and Desktop GUIs) levels and in different sectors, such as IoT, automotive, robotics, VR/AR and many others!

I definitely learned a lot, but after 4 years it was time to change and focus on specific aspects of software development.

Right now, I'm working at [Zupit](https://zupit.it) as Full-Stack developer (currently with .NET + Angular). Zupit is a small software house in Trento (Italy) focused on providing custom and quality software to its customers. The company values work-life balance and continuous learning. In fact, I work for 6 hours a day, and have more time for learning and relaxing! However, less time doesn't mean less work: the focus is on improving developer productivity and on shipping value faster, without compromising on quality. 

### Why?

I love programming and computers in general, as they allow to "create" without much effort and investment.
Everyone can learn and create on the web, and currently also in the physical world (looking at you, 3D!), just by buying or even just renting a PC/laptop/raspberry/wathever!

Also, anyone can show their knowledge and opinions without restrictions in most of the world, and all this information is available to everyone with an internet connection.

That's why I decided to learn programming and software engineering, and also why I'm opening a small window into my world (this website).

Hope you'll enjoy it!
